MDD is a fullstack web application designed to facilitate content sharing and user interactions around thematic articles. Users can register, subscribe to themes, publish articles, and engage through comments. The application ensures a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.

This project follows a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** approach, focusing solely on essential functionalities without a dedicated back-office.


## Repository structure

```
/Savasana app
â”‚â”€â”€ /front    # Angular application
â”‚â”€â”€ /back     # Spring Boot API
â”‚â”€â”€ /resources   # Additional project resources (postman collection, sql script, coverage)
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md    # Main project documentation (you are here)
```

Each section has its own **README file** with specific installation and setup instructions:  

- ðŸ“„ **Frontend** (`/front/README.md`) â€“ Angular application setup and usage  
- ðŸ“„ **Backend** (`/back/README.md`) â€“ Spring Boot API setup and usage
